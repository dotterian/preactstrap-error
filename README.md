Demo project to show error when trying to use Reactstrap with Preact

## Instructions

```
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
```

## Current behaviour
Error due to Reactstrap utilizing 'react-lifecycles-compat'

## Expected behaviour
You should see default create-react-app application with Reactstrap button rendered at the bottom of it (Won't be pretty, because I didn't add any bootstrap stylesheet :))
